Ranging over 1,000 miles from Anchorage, in south central Alaska, to Nome on the western Bering Sea coast. Mail and supplies went in. Gold came out. All via dog sled. In 1925, part of the Iditarod Trail became a life saving highway for epidemic-stricken Nome. Diphtheria threatened and serum had to be brought in; again by intrepid dog mushers and their faithful hard-driving dogs.  Throughout the years, the sled dogs were important to day to day life in the villages and throughout Alaska.  \n\nThe first Iditarod race to Nome started March 3, 1973. Every year, men and women dog sled teams battle the harsh Alaskan elements in the \u201cLast Great Race on Earth\u00ae\u201d. The race route is alternated every year, one year going north through Cripple, Ruby and Galena, the next year south through Iditarod, Shageluk, Anvik. \n\nVisit <a href=\"https://iditarod.com/\">the Iditarod website</a> for more delightful information about The Last Great Race!",

Some prepare around a full-time job. In addition to planning the equipment and feeding needs for themselves and their 16-dog teams for up to three weeks on the trail, hundreds of hours and hundreds of miles of training have to be put on each dog team.
